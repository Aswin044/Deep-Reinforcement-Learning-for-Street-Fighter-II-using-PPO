📌 Overview

This project implements a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to play Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition.
It features a custom Gym Retro environment, preprocessing pipeline, reward shaping, hyperparameter optimization, and an interpretability framework designed to make the RL agent transparent and explainable.
